<h1>Pacman</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pacman game, developed as an educational tool to help understand and apply various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The game is built using Python and is designed to demonstrate the practical use of algorithms in a fun and interactive way.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic Pacman Gameplay:</strong> Navigate the maze, eat all the dots, and avoid the ghosts.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Algorithmic Challenges:</strong> Different levels are designed to teach and apply various algorithms, such as:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pathfinding Algorithms:</strong> Implement and visualize algorithms like BFS, DFS, A* in real-time as Pacman finds his way through the maze.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Utilize stacks, queues, priority queues, and more to manage game states and AI decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Graph Theory:</strong> Represent the maze as a graph and explore graph traversal techniques.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Educational Mode:</strong> Step through the algorithms used in the game with detailed explanations and visual aids.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Levels:</strong> Create your own maze layouts and challenges to explore different algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Language: Python</li>
  <li>Libraries:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>`<strong>pygame</strong>` for game development and visualization.</li>
    <li>`<strong>numpy</strong>` and `<strong>networkx</strong>` for data structures and algorithm implementations.</li>
  </ul>
  
</ul>
